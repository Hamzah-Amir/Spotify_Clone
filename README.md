# Spotify Clone - Web Music Player

A responsive and interactive web-based music player inspired by Spotify's UI. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this clone allows you to browse albums, play/pause tracks, view seekbars, and control volume.

> **Note:** This project is part of my learning journey in the **Sigma Web Development Course by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.codewithharry.com/)**.
